# Next.js App Router Patterns

Follow these patterns when working with Next.js App Router in this SaaS scaffold:

## Client vs Server Components

- Default to Server Components unless you need client-side interactivity
- Add 'use client' directive only when needed (hooks, event handlers, browser APIs)
- Keep client components as small and focused as possible

## Data Fetching

- Use server components for data fetching when possible
- Fetch data directly in server components without useEffect
- Follow React's recommended patterns for async/await in server components
- For client components, use SWR or React Query for data fetching with proper error handling and loading states

## Route Groups and Layouts

- Use route groups (folders with parentheses) to organize related routes that share a layout
- Create specific layouts for each section (marketing, dashboard, auth)
- Avoid deep nesting of layouts to prevent performance issues
- Use loading.tsx files for streaming and Suspense

## Metadata

- Define metadata at the layout or page level
- Use dynamic metadata generation for SEO optimization
- Follow this pattern for metadata:

```tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Page Title | SaaS App",
  description: "Page description for SEO",
}
```

## Error Handling

- Implement error.tsx files for graceful error handling
- Create not-found.tsx files for 404 scenarios
- Use try/catch blocks for error handling in server actions and components

## API Routes

- Use Route Handlers (route.ts) for API endpoints
- Structure API routes by feature (e.g., /api/stripe/webhook)
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Add authentication checks for protected endpoints

## Navigation

- Use Next.js Link component for client-side navigation
- Implement proper routing with dynamic segments when needed
- Avoid hardcoded URLs, use relative paths or route constants
